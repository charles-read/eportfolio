        <h2><u>Aspirations from my Studies</u></h2>
        <p> Looking forward, I am excited to see what I can accomplish once I graduate from my Computer Science degree. I would like to be employed and work in a company that is researching and developing technologies that are evolving and changing how the world functions. For me, seeing change is a big part of what motivates me and I believe that working in a company that contributes to the evolving industry of technology would be the perfect scenario for my career.</p>
