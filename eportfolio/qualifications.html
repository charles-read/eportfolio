            From my time at college studying my Extended Diploma in software development I gained a great deal of knowledge on programming as well as programming techniques to make code more readable as well as efficient. For example, I was introduced to different programming paradigms such as object oriented programming which I learnt in units (modules) such as ‘Developing Computer Games’ and ‘Software Design and Development’. I also studied ‘Communication and Employability Skills for IT’ criteria which taught me many new ways, not only to improve my self-confidence and communication skills, but also to learn professional methods to track and monitor my progression throughout my education and future career. I have carried these techniques and habits with me and help me to organize and record my progress so I can see my personal development.
            <br><br>
           A strong example of development of my programming as well as communication skills while doing my college course was in the “Developing Computer Games” unit/module where I had to work in a team designing and developing an original game. We had to arrange, as a team, to complete different parts then put our code together to form the complete game which in our case was a side scrolling adventure game written in a Greenfoot Java environment. The game development improved my programming skills drastically as many hours were spent on the project and the game was a success on completion after being awarded 87/100 (Distinction).

            My qualifications during secondary school were very important as they build a foundation of knowledge which I can add to. The Business and ICT qualifications I studied here were broad and gave me an insight into the subject whist preparing me for my college course and future careers.

            Before university, alongside my college course I was working part time at Maplin Electronics as a sales advisor. Throughout the time I spent there, I gained many skills and my technical knowledge with computer hardware and small electrical components dramatically improved over the years I worked there. I also learnt to work in a team effectively and improved my communication skills. Most importantly, my confidence has grown as I am now more comfortable public speaking for college presentations and general teamwork activities.
