        <h2><u>Hobbies and Interests</u></h2>
        <p> In my spare time, I enjoy maintaining and upgrading computer hardware as well as messing around with code from video games to adjust features. Programming has been a hobby of mine for many years and I have found myself intrigued and always wanting to learn more techniques and languages.  I used to be a YouTube content creator where I created educational videos reviewing modifications for video games in my spare time. Doing this I spent a lot of time not only dealing with these modifications, but also video editing and creating graphics. Because of this past-experience, I am familiar in many graphic design programs such as PhotoShop and Sony Vegas Pro. After being intrigued by a website design college module, I also have worked with web elements in my spare time to create and edit websites for myself and close family members.</p>
